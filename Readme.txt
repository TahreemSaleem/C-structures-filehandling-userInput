A C program which takes total_sec as an Input and then stores that in equivalent time in hours (0-23) , minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59), respectively, using structures. Use file handling to write into the file and read from file. For example, with an input of  8000 seconds. Output is, 
Time is: 2:13:20 
After writing "Time is: ", use the concept of random access file to write the time "2:13:20". 
And for reading, only show the output of "2:13:20" on the screen by using random access file.
